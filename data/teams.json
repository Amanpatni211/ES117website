Pinion rotates. Pinion connected to generator.\nUpward movement: Another rack or one-way clutch extracts energy again.\nSo compression + return both produce rotation.\nSo generator receives power from:\n 1)Horizontal rolling\n2)Vertical compression",

Before starting the ride, the app records a short video of the cycle to document its condition and uploads it to cloud storage with a timestamp.\nThe backend verifies the request and sends an unlock command to a smart lock. The ride timer runs on the server to prevent manipulation. After returning the cycle, the user uploads another video, and the system calculates the total cost based on time used and any late fees. Payment is completed through an integrated gateway.",
